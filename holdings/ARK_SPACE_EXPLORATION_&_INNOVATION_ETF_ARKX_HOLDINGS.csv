"The  principal  risks  of  investing  in  ARK  ETFs  include  equity,  market,  management  and  non-diversification  risks,  as  well  as  fluctuations  in  market  value  and  net  asset  value  ('NAV').  Investors  should  carefully  consider  the  investment  objectives  and  risks  as  well  as  charges  and  expenses  of  an  ETF  before  investing.  This  and  other  information  are  contained  in  each  ETF's  prospectus,  which  may  be  obtained  by  contacting  the  ETF's  transfer  agent  The  Bank  of  New  York  Mellon  or  by  clicking  here.  Please  read  the  prospectus  carefully  before  you  invest.  The  market  price  of  ETF  shares  may  differ  significantly  from  their  NAV  during  periods  of  market  volatility.  ETF  shares  may  only  be  redeemed  directly  with  the  ETF  at  NAV  by  Authorized  Participants,  in  very  large  creation  units.  Holdings  are  subject  to  change  without  notice  and  are  not  a  recommendation  to  buy  or  sell  any  security.  There  can  be  no  guarantee  that  an  active  trading  market  for  ETF  shares  will  develop  or  be  maintained,  or  that  their  listing  will  continue  or  remain  unchanged.  Buying  or  selling  ETF  shares  on  an  exchange  may  require  the  payment  of  brokerage  commissions  and  frequent  trading  may  incur  brokerage  costs  that  detract  significantly  from  investment  returns.
