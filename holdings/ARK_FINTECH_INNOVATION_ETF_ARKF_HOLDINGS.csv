There  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  ARK  ETFs  will  achieve  their  investment  objectives.  The  ARK  ETFs'  portfolios  are  more  volatile  than  broad  market  averages.  The  ARK  ETFs  also  have  specific  risks,  which  are  described  in  the  ARK  ETFs'  prospectuses,  Shares  of  the  ARK  ETFs  may  be  bought  or  sold  throughout  the  day  at  their  market  price  on  the  exchange  on  which  they  are  listed.
