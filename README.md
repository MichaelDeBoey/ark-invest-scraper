# ark-invest-scraper
Pulling a history of the holdings for ark invest funds https://ark-funds.com/

They also provide the last year's worth of trades in PDF, which I'm not currently scraping https://ark-invest.com/wp-content/trades/ARK_Trades.pdf

If you are doing historical analysis, note that some files were renamed around 10/17/2021 - see https://github.com/tigger0jk/ark-invest-scraper/issues/6#issuecomment-945188594 for details. Also at various times there have been scraping errors that resulted in bad data being committed - other issues should track most or all of those outages.
